  "ICTInstallActor — the ISCO-08 7422 Information and Communications
  Technology Installers and Servicers site scheduling/logistics
  coordination actor as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
  (ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section). One graph run = one
  site-coordination operation request (intake -> advise -> govern ->
  decide -> commit/hold, with a human-approval interrupt for
  escalated proposals). No infinite internal loop; checkpointed per
  superstep so an interrupted run can resume after human sign-off.
  Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-7412's elecmech.actor (closest domain
  shape — same physical-safety-domain, certification-gated
  technician-safety pattern).

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold               (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the ICT Installation Advisor can never
  directly commit an operating record the ICTInstallGovernor refuses,
  and can never make this actor finalize an installation-execution
  decision (e.g. proceeding with a specific cable/equipment
  installation), authorize a network/electrical-compliance-clearance
  determination, or override a site safety officer's judgment — every
  commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`, and that decision
  class is a permanent hard block regardless of disposition path.
  This actor coordinates SITE SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never
  performs installation work or makes compliance-clearance decisions
  itself."
